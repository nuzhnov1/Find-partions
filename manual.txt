NAME
    findpart - finds the number of all possible partitions of the number "n"
    into "k" terms by sequential and parallel methods.

SYNOPSIS
    findpart
    findpart [options] [<Value of "n"> <Value of "k">]

DESCRIPTION
    Finds the number of all possible partitions of the non negative number "n".
    MPI technology is used for parallel computing.

    The program operates in three modes: if the "n" and "k" arguments are not
    specified, the manual is being printed.
    If the both numbers are specified, then this problem is solved by the
    methods specified using the "-s" and "-m" flags
    (by default, only the "-m" flag is used).

OPTIONS
    -s
        Use sequential computing
    
    -m
        Use parallel computing
